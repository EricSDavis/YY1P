## Calling loops with SIP

The following scripts were run on UNC longleaf to call loops
from bio-rep combined Hi-C files with SIP:

```{bash}
sh callLoopsBioreps.sh
sh callLoopsGenotype.sh
```

Loop calls are located in this directory on UNC's longleaf cluster:
`/work/users/e/s/esdavis/YY1P/sip_loops`.
